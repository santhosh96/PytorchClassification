# Pytorch Classification
A generalized structure for building image classification models using Pytorch

## Getting Started

Please follow the instructions given below for setting up the environment

### Prerequisites

Following are the packages and libraries required for running the model

```
numpy >= 1.16.3
opencv-python >= 4.1.0.25
pandas >= 0.24.2
scikit-learn >= 0.21.1
torch >= 1.1.0
torchvision >= 0.3.0
```

### Setting up the environment (Optional)

The libraries and packages mentioned in pre-requisities can be installed directly, but creating a virtual environment is recommended

* Command for installing virtual environment:
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```
* Command for creating and activating the virtual environment:
```
virtualenv pytorchclassification
source pytorchclassification/bin/activate
```
* Command for deactivating the virtual environment
```
deactivate
```

### Installing the packages

The required packages and libraries can be installed by following command
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
